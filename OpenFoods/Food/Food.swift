      Pasta is a type of food typically made from an unleavened dough of wheat flour mixed with
      water or eggs, and formed into sheets or other shapes, then cooked by boiling or baking. Rice
      flour, or legumes such as beans or lentils, are sometimes used in place of wheat flour to
      yield a different taste and texture, or as a gluten-free alternative. Pasta is a staple food
      of Italian ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ cuisine.
